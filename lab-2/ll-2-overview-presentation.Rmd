.panel[.panel-name[Recap]

- We have _four learning labs_ within the _machine learning topic area_
    - Each is associated with ne badge
- We began with _supervised machine learning_ and focused on its **predictive** emphasis
    - We talked a bit about plans for using ML
    - We worked through a presentation (reflection: the code-along took to long)
    - We started on the case study
    
]

.panel[.panel-name[A few more thoughts]

- If you are still figuring out how you are planning to use ML . . . 
    - Great! Let's make progress today (and this week)
- If you have a _specific use of ML in mind_ . . . 
    - Make sense of the labs
    - And, at the same time, begin to look for _how_ you can achieve your goal
        - R packages (recently updated, with good documentation, with active users, compatibility, papers)
- Machine learning is _not_ magical

]

.panel[.panel-name[Logistics]

- Links to presentations are here: https://laser-institute.github.io/machine-learning
    - And in the machine learning "team": https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/machine-learning
- GitHub will probably continue to work, but be challenging (but should be less so)
    - You'll need to fork the repository to "submit" your badge; you can do this at any time (through GitHub.com or GitHub Desktop)
- Installation of required packages will continue to work, but may be challenging (but should be less so)

]

.panel[.panel-name[Plan for today]

- **This morning**
    - We'll spend the first _30 minutes_ of our 75 minutes working through the case study and badge activity
    - Then, we'll start the presentation for learning lab #2
- **This afternoon**
    - We'll spend the first _10-20 minutes_ finishing the presentation for learning lab #1
    - Then, you'll have time to _continue the case study and badge activity for learning lab #1_
        - Or, you can move on to the case study and badge activity for learning lab #2

### Turn to an elbow partner and discuss:

- Any additional thoughts on the following?
    - Which modality (supervised or unsupervised machine learning) are you interested in using?
    - What data or context are you interested in for your use of ML?

# Background

- In the last learning lab, we did a nice job of training a model that was _pretty good_
- But, can we do better?
- This question motivates this learning lab, specifically:
    - Answering it
    - And, developing a _means_ to answer it in a way that does not introduce bias into our analysis
- Feature engineering is a key way we can improve our model
- Feature engineering refers to the part of machine learning wherein we decide which variables to include in which forms

# Core Concepts

---

# Why feature engineering matters

- Let's consider a very simple data set, one with _time series_ (or longitudinal) data for a single student

```{r, include = FALSE}
d <- tibble(student_id = "janyia", time_point = 1:10, var_a = c(0.01, 0.32, 0.32, 0.34, 0.04, 0.54, 0.56, 0.75, 0.63, 0.78))
```

```{r}
d
```

- **How can we include a variable, `var_a`, in a machine learning model?**

---

# How can we include a single variable?

Let's take a look at the variable

```{r}
d %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = time_point, y = var_a)) +
    geom_point()
```

---

# How can we include a single variables

- Well, what if we just add the values for these variables directly
- But, that ignores that they are at different time points
    - We could include the time point variable, but that is (about) the same for every student

*What are some other ideas?*

---

# A few (other) options

- Raw data points
- Their mean
- Their maximum
- Their variability (standard deviation)
- Their linear slope
- Their quadratic slope

**Each of these may derive from a single _variable_ but may offer predictive utility as distinct _features_**

---

# Let's consider one more example

Here's a time stamp:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Sys.time()
```

**How could this variable be used as a predictor variable?**

---

# Discussion

.pull-left[
### Turn to an elbow partner and discuss:

- What _variables_ might you use in your use of ML?
- What _features_ could be created from these variables?
- What is unclear or about what do you have a question (so far)?
]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/joro-pointing.jpeg", error = FALSE)
```
]
---

# What else should we consider?

## For all variables

- Removing those with "near-zero variance"
- Removing ID variables and others that _should not be_ informative
- Imputing missing values
- Extract particular elements (i.e., particular _days_ or _times_) from time-related data 

## For specific types of variables

- Categorical variables
    - Dummy coding 
    - Combining categories
- Numeric variables
    - Normalizing ("standardizing")

---

# How to do this?

- We can do all of these things manually
- But, there are also helpful functions to do this
- Any, the {recipes} package makes it practical to carry out feature engineering steps for not only single variables, but groups of variables (or all of the variables)
- Examples, all of which start with `step()`:
    - `step_dummy()`
    - `step_normalize()`
    - `step_nzv()`
    - `step_impute_knn()`

*We'll dive in deeper in the code examples*

---

# The importance of training data

- Training data is what we use to "learn" from data
- A "check" on your work is your predictions on _test_ set data
  - *Train data*: Outcome data that you use to fit your model
  - *Validation data<sup>1</sup>*: Data you use to select a particular algorithm
  - *Test ("hold-out") data*: Data that you do not use in any way to train your model

.footnote[
[1] not always/often used in practice, for reasons we'll discuss momentarily
]

# The problem introduced by feature engineering

In LL1, we fit and interpreted a single model; let's think carefully through how we "spent" our training and testing data in that lab

--

*Training data*: Used this set (80%) of the data to train our model
*Testing data*: Evaluated the performance of the model using this set (20%) of the data

--

What if we decided to _add new features_ or _change existing features_?

We'd need to use the same training data to tune a new model---and the same testing data to evaluate its performance

--

**But, doing this could lead us to specifying a model based on how well we predict the data that happened to end up in the testing set. We could be optimizing our model for our testing data; when used with new data, that model could do poorly.**

---

# The problem introduced by feature engineering

- In short, a challenges arises when we wish to use our training data _more than once_

-- 

- Namely, if we repeatedly training an algorithm on the same data and then make changes, we may be tailoring our model to specific features of the testing data

-- 

- This is a _very common and pervasive problem_ in machine learning applications

-- 

- Resampling conserves our testing data; we don't have to spend it until we've finalized our model

---

# Resampling (and _k_-folds cross-validation)

- Resampling involves blurring the boundaries between training and testing data, _but only for the training split of the data_

--

- Specifically, it involves combining these two portions of our data into one, iteratively considering:
    - Some of the data to be for "training"
    - Some for "testing"

--

- Then, fit measures are **averaged** across these different samples

--

---

# *k*-folds cross validation

- One of the most common and useful forms of resampling is *k*-folds cross validation
    - Here, some of the data is considered to be a part of the *training* set 
    - The remaining data is a part of the *testing* set

--

- How many sets (samples taken through resampling)?
    - This is determined by _k_, number of times the data is resampled
    - When _k_ is equivalent to the number of rows in the data, this is often called "Leave One Out Cross-Validation" (LOOCV) 

---

# Let's consider an example

Say we have a data set, `d`, with 100 observations (rows or data points) with _k_ = 10.

```{r, include = FALSE}
d <- tibble(id = 1:100, var_a = runif(100), var_b = runif(100))
```

```{r}
d
```

**Using _k_ = 10, how can we split this data into ten distinct training and testing sets?**

---

# First resampling

```{r}
train <- d[1:90, ]
test <- d[91:100, ]

train  %>% head(3)
test %>% head(3)
# then, train the model (using train) and calculate a fit measure (using test)
```

---

# Second resampling

```{r}
train <- d[c(1:80, 91:100), ]
test <- d[81:90, ]

train  %>% head(3)
test %>% head(3)
# then, train the model (using train) and calculate a fit measure (using test)
```

---

# Third resampling

```{r}
train <- d[c(1:70, 81:100), ]
test <- d[71:80, ]

train  %>% head(3)
test %>% head(3)
# then, train the model (using train) and calculate a fit measure (using test)
```

... through the tenth resampling, after which the fit measures are simply summed

--

That's it! Thankfully, we have automated tools to do this that we'll work on in the code examples

---

# But how do you determine what _k_ should be?

- A _historically common value_ for _k_ has been 10
- But, as computers have grown in processing power, setting _k_ equal to the number of rows in the data has become more common

# Code Examples

*Note how these steps are the same as in the classification example for LL 1*

---

# Let's walk through a few steps

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[0]

**Prepare**

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

d <- read_csv("data/online-sci-data-joined.csv")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[1]

**Split data**

```{r panel-chunk-1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(20220712)

train_test_split <- initial_split(d, prop = .80)

data_train <- training(train_test_split)

kfcv <- vfold_cv(data_train, v = 10) # this differentiates this from what we did before
# before, we simple used data_train to fit our model
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[2]

**Engineer features**

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
recipe(final_grade ~ ., data = data_train) %>% # **edit**: change t final grade
    update_role(student_id, course_id, section, new_role = "ID variable") %>% # this can be any string; for ID variables
    step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% # standardizes numeric variables
    step_nzv(all_predictors()) %>% # remove predictors with a "near-zero variance"
    step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%  # dummy code all factor variables
    step_novel(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% # add a musing label for factors
    step_impute_knn(all_predictors()) # impute missing data for all predictor variables
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[3]

**Specify the model and workflow**
 
```{r panel-chunk-3, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
my_mod <-
    linear_reg() %>% # note the difference here
    set_engine("glm") %>% 
    set_mode("regression") # and here

# specify workflow
my_wf <-
    workflow() %>%
    add_model(my_mod) %>% 
    add_recipe(my_rec)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[4]

**Fit model**

```{r panel-chunk-4, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fitted_model <- fit_resamples(my_wf, resamples = kfcv,
                              control = control_grid(save_pred = TRUE)) # this allows us to inspect the predictions
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[5]

**Evaluate accuracy**

```{r panel-chunk-5, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fitted_model %>% 
    unnest(.metrics) %>% 
    filter(.metric == "rmse") # we also get another metric, the ROC; we focus just on accuracy for now
```
]
]

---

# What's next?

- **Case study**: You'll run all of this code, focusing on feature engineering and working with resamples
- **Independent practice**: In the independent practice, you'll focus on adding a new (not yet used!) feature engineering step
