### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Part A:

1.  Which features are most relevant to your work? For each, briefly explain why.

    -   

2.  Which feature engineering steps are necessary to include those in a model?

    -   

Part B: Once again, use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies machine learning to an educational context aligned with your research interests. More specifically, please find an article in your field that utilizes in *feature engineering*

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What is the data source used in the study?

    -   

3.  Why was feature engineering *useful* or even *necessary* in this study?

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

For this data product, please add a feature (or several features) *specific to one or more of the activity types* in the OULAD interactions data, and then add these features to your model and evaluate the accuracy. How did the accuracy appreciably change--if at all? Please copy all of your code in one or more code chunks below.

### Knit and Publish

Complete the following steps to knit and publish your work:

1.  First, change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/rmarkdown-anatomy.html#yaml-metadata) at the very top of this document to your name. The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Next, click the knit button in the toolbar above to "knit" your R Markdown document to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder. You should see a formatted webpage appear in your Viewer tab in the lower right pan or in a new browser window. Let's us know if you run into any issues with knitting.

3.  Finally, publish your webpage on Posit Cloud by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane after you knit your document. See screenshot below.
