        "After interpreting our last model, it is easy to think we can do a little better. But, how? In this module, we'll do do things: 1) specify a more sophisticated model and 2) go deeper on some feature engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our driving question for this module, then, is: **How much can we improve our model?** Looking back to our predictive model from module 3, we can see that our accuracy was okay. Can we improve on that? Let's dive in! First, we'll briefly review two key concepts for the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "### A more sophisticated model\n",
        "\n",
        "we attempt to improve our predictive performance by switching to a more complex model than the logistic regression we have been using–specifically, to a type of model that is based on decision trees – a boosted‑tree model. In short, this is one way we can improve our model's predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosted trees (gradient boosting) build a *sequence* of small \"decision trees\" (detailed in the conceptual overview), each one focusing on the records the previous trees struggled with. When tuned carefully (small learning rate, many trees) the ensemble can outperform other algorithms based on decision trees you may have heard of, like the random forest algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "### A little background (and some readings) on feature engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature engineering is a rich topic in machine learning research, including in the learning analytics and educational data mining communities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider research on online learning and the work of Rodriguez et al. (2021). In this study, *digital trace data*, data generated through users' interactions with digital technologies. Optionally, review this paper -- specifically how they processed the \"clickstream\" data. As this paper illustrates, there is not one way to use such data.\n",

In *LAK21: 11th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference* (pp. 313-322).\n",
        "\n",
        "Notably, the authors took several steps to prepare the data so that it could be validly interpreted. The same is true here in the context of machine learning. In a different context, the work of Gobert et al. (2013) is a great example of using data from educational simulations. Optionally review this paper, too, focused on their use of a technique they called *replay tagging* to conduct feature engineering.\n",

        "\n",
        "Even after feature engineering, machine learning approaches can often (but not always) be improved by choosing a more sophisticated model type. Note how we used a regression model in the first two case studies; here, we explore a considerably more sophisticated model, a boosted tree. Feature engineering and choosing a more sophisticated model adds some complexity to the modeling. As we have discussed, it is easy to bias our results if we repeatedly check the performance of *different model fits* with the same test data. Cross-validation is one commonly used solution for this problem.\n",
