# Machine Learning Learning Labs

Machine learning is increasingly prevalent in our lives---and in educational contexts. Its role in educational research and practice is growing, albeit with some challenges and even controversy. These learning labs are designed to familiarize you with machine learning and its applications in STEM education research. Throughout the module, we'll explore four key questions that correspond to the focus of each of the four learning labs. By the end, you will have a deep understanding of the key characteristics of machine learning and how to implement machine learning workflows in R and Python.

## Learning Lab 1: Supervised Machine Learning (SML) Foundations

How is prediction different from explanation? This lab provides a gentle introduction to supervised machine learning by drawing out similarities to and differences from a regression modeling approach. The case study will involve modeling the graduation rate across 1000s of higher education institutions in the United States using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).

## Learning Lab 2: Workflows With Training and Testing Data

Building on the foundations from Lab 1, this session delves deeper into the workflows we will use when we are using a SML approach. Particularly, we'll explore the roles of training and testing data and when to use them in a SML workflow. We'll predict students' withdrawal from a course using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD).

## Learning Lab 3: Interpreting SML Metrics

How is the interpretation of SML models different from more familiar models? In this lab, we'll explore and work to understand the confusion matrix that can and the various metrics (e.g., precision, recall, PPV, NPV, F-score, and AUC) that are used to interpret how good at making dichotomous predictions SML models are. We'll again use the OULAD, augmenting the variables we used in Lab 1, and we'll introduce a more complex model---the random forest model---as an alternative to the regression models used in previous labs.

## Learning Lab 4: Improving Predictions Through Feature Engineering

How can we improve our predictions? This lab introduces the concept of feature engineering to enhance model performance. We'll explore techniques for creating new variables and refining existing ones to improve prediction accuracy. We also explore cross-validation to revise and refine our model without biasing its predictions. We'll work with the finest-grained OULAD data—interaction data—to demonstrate key feature engineering steps.

## Microcredential

To earn the SML micro-credential, you will carry out an SML analysis using data of your choosing and report the results in a Quarto document. Emphasize *why* you are using SML (relative to regression or another approach) and use feature engineering and cross-validation to refine your model. Lastly, interpret your model carefully by going beyond reporting accuracy to report the specific metrics for the strength of your SML model's predictions, given the particular aims of your analysis.
