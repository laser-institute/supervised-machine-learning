## 1. PREPARE

We'll focus on the core parts of doing a machine learning analysis in Python, this time bringing into the picture the key concept of training and testing data, which we deliberately omitted from the last case study. We'll use the {[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)} library (add-ons) to do so, like in the first module. However, to help anchor our analysis and provide us with some direction, we'll focus on the following research question as we explore this new approach:

> How well can we predict which institutions have higher graduation rates?

This builds directly on the work from Module 1, where we started investigating this question. In this module, we'll properly implement a training and testing workflow to evaluate our predictions more rigorously. We'll also investigate our data set further to ensure that we understand what goes into the model!

Please review this chapter, focusing on the overall goals of the analysis and how the analysis was presented (focusing on predictions, rather than the ways we may typically interpret a statistical model--like measures of statistical significance).

### 1b. Load Packages

Like in the last module, please load the pandas data wrangling library, the *numpy* numerical library and *matplotlib* for basic plotting. We will also import [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) (a more feature-rich data visualization tool) which will be introduced later in the case study.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
```

We will also load a few scikit-learn tools to use in later this case study:

```{python}
# The same model from module-1
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# New scikit-learn tools we'll explore in this case study
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

## 2. WRANGLE

In general, data wrangling involves some combination of cleaning, reshaping, transforming, and merging data (Wickham & Grolemund, 2017). The importance of data wrangling is difficult to overstate, as it involves the initial steps of going from raw data to a dataset that can be explored and modeled (Krumm et al, 2018).

### 2a. Import and Inspect Data

For this module, we'll be working with the same IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) dataset we used in Module 1. Let's read it in:

```{python}
ipeds_df = pd.read_csv("data/ipeds-all-title-9-2022-data.csv")
```

We'll use the same data cleaning steps from Module 1:

```{python}
{python}
column_map = {
    'institution name': 'name',
    'HD2022.Postsecondary and Title IV institution indicator': 'title_iv',  # is the university a title IV university?
    'HD2022.Carnegie Classification 2021: Basic': 'carnegie_class',  # which carnegie classification
    'HD2022.State abbreviation': 'state',  # state
    'DRVEF2022.Total  enrollment': 'total_enroll',  # total enrollment
    'DRVADM2022.Percent admitted - total': 'pct_admitted',  # percentage of applicants admitted
    "DRVC2022.Bachelor's degree": 'n_bach',  # number of students receiving a bachelor's degree
    "DRVC2022.Master's degree": 'n_mast',  # number of students receiving a master's degree
    "DRVC2022.Doctor's degree - research/scholarship": 'n_doc',  # number receive a doctoral degree
    'DRVIC2022.Tuition and fees, 2021-22': 'tuition_fees',  # total cost of tuition and fees
    'DRVGR2022.Graduation rate, total cohort': 'grad_rate',  # graduation rate
    'SFA2122.Percent of full-time first-time undergraduates awarded any financial aid': 'percent_fin_aid',  # percent of students receive financial aid
    'DRVHR2022.Average salary equated to 9 months of full-time instructional staff - all ranks': 'avg_salary'  # average salary of instructional staff
}

ipeds_df = ipeds_df.rename(columns=column_map)  # first map column names ... 
ipeds_df = ipeds_df[column_map.values()]  # then select the columns it mapped.
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Just as we did in Module 1, let's filter the data to include only Title IV postsecondary institutions.

```{python}
ipeds_df = ipeds_df.query('title_iv == "Title IV postsecondary institution"')  # filter to Title IV
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Now, filter the data again to *only* include institutions with a carnegie classification. Specifically, exclude those institutions with a value for the `carnegie_class` variable that is "Not applicable, not in Carnegie universe (not accredited or nondegree-granting)". As a hint: whereas the logical operator `==` is used to include only matching conditions, the logical operator `!=` excludes matching conditions.

```{python}
ipeds_df = ipeds_df.query('carnegie_class != "Not applicable, not in Carnegie universe (not accredited or nondegree-granting)"')
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Let's inspect our data - using .`head()` or another means of your choosing below.

```{python}
ipeds_df.head()
```

Write down a few observations after inspecting the data:

### 2b. Transform Variables

We'll now transform our graduation rate variable into a binary outcome for our classification task, just as we did in Module 1.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Create a binary variable called `good_grad_rate` that indicates whether an institution has a graduation rate above a certain threshold. Choose a threshold that seems reasonable to you.

```{python}
ipeds_df['good_grad_rate'] = np.where(ipeds_df['grad_rate'] > 70, 1, 0)
```

Here, add a reason or two for how and why you picked the threshold you did:

## 3. EXPLORE

As noted by Krumm et al. (2018), exploratory data analysis often involves some combination of data visualization and *feature engineering*. In Part 3, we will create a quick visualization to help us spot any potential issues with our data and engineer new predictive variables or "features" that we will use in our predictive models.

### 3a. Examine Variables

Let's take a closer look at our institutional data. In the chunk below, count the number of institutions with good and poor graduation rates.

```{python}
ipeds_df['good_grad_rate'].value_counts()
```

What does this tell us?

We can see how many institutions have good and not-so-good graduations rates -- and what percentage of the data is missing.

Next, let's visualize the distribution of graduation rates to better understand our data:

```{python}
plt.hist(ipeds_df['grad_rate'], bins=range(0, 105, 5), color='skyblue', edgecolor='white')
plt.title("Distribution of Graduation Rates")
plt.xlabel("Graduation Rate (%)")
plt.ylabel("Number of Institutions")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Create another visualization that explores the relationship between two variables in our dataset. For example, you might want to look at the relationship between tuition fees and graduation rates, or enrollment and graduation rates.

```{python}
# Add your visualization code here

```

One last, critical step is understanding missingness in our data. The `isnull()` method is fantastic for this --- when combined with the `sum()` method it tells us the number of missing values for each variable in our data set.

```{python}
ipeds_df.isnull().sum()
```

From this, we can see that several variables have considerable missingness. For example, the `pct_admitted` variable has more than half of its values missing! There are ways to deal with this (real-life datasets, including the IPEDS data, are rife with missing values for a whole host of reasons). We will address those (e.g., imputation) later.

For this analysis, though, we'll focus on the variables that have relatively few missing values - `tuition_fees`, `percent_fin_aid`, `avg_salary`, and our dependent variable, `good_grad_rate`. This will be a simple model --- simpler in terms of the features than the model in the first analysis, but with the knowledge that we are using variables that are more complete.

### 3b. Feature Engineering

As defined by Krumm, Means, and Bienkowski (2018) in *Learning Analytics Goes to School*:

> **Feature engineering** is the process of creating new variables within a dataset, which goes above and beyond the work of recoding and rescaling variables.

The authors note that feature engineering draws on substantive knowledge from theory or practice, experience with a particular data system, and general experience in data-intensive research. Moreover, these features can be used not only in machine learning models, but also in visualizations and tables comprising descriptive statistics.

Though not as often discussed as other steps, feature engineering is an important step. You can read more about feature engineering [here](https://www.tmwr.org/recipes.html).

For this module, we'll create a new feature that might help predict graduation rates. Let's create a derived variable representing the ratio of tuition and fees to average salary, which could indicate the institution's value proposition.

```{python}
ipeds_df['tuition_to_salary_ratio'] = ipeds_df['tuition_fees'] / ipeds_df['avg_salary']
```

Let's examine this new feature:

```{python}
sns.kdeplot(  # builds a density plot
    data=ipeds_df,
    x='tuition_to_salary_ratio',
    hue='good_grad_rate',
    fill=True,
)

plt.title("Density of Tuition-to-Salary Ratio by Graduation Rate Quality")
plt.xlabel("Tuition to Salary Ratio")
plt.ylabel("Density")
plt.show()
```

Something is very not right. It seems like there may be some number that is way off -- and that's skewing the plot in a weird way.

What's going on? In this case, it can be helpful to get eyes on the data to see if anything funny seems to be going on. Let's take a look at the relevant variables:

```{python}
columns_to_inspect = ['name', 'tuition_fees', 'avg_salary', 'tuition_to_salary_ratio']
ipeds_df[columns_to_inspect].sort_values(by='tuition_to_salary_ratio', ascending=False)
```

Do you spot the problem? Add a note below about what it might be:

-   YOUR RESPONSE HERE

As you likely noticed, it looks like one institution - Beckfield College-Florence - has an average salary of \$1 for their graduates. As a result, the ratio of tuition and fees relative to salary is *huge* -- far larger than for any other institutions! What to do here? This seems almost certain to be an error in data reporting or recording. We can safely filter out this one row with some simple logic.

```{python}
ipeds_df = ipeds_df.query("avg_salary > 1")
```

Let's try to create that plot again:

```{python}
sns.kdeplot(  # builds a density plot
    data=ipeds_df,
    x='tuition_to_salary_ratio',
    hue='good_grad_rate',
    fill=True,
)

plt.title("Density of Tuition-to-Salary Ratio by Graduation Rate Quality")
plt.xlabel("Tuition to Salary Ratio")
plt.ylabel("Density")
plt.show()
```

That's better! Add a note on what this graph might mean below:

We're now ready to proceed to the five machine learning (modeling) steps!

## 4. MODEL

In this step, we will dive into the SML modeling process in much more depth than in the last module.

1.  **Split Data** into a training and test set that will be used to develop a predictive model;

2.  **Create a "Pipeline"** for our predictive model and learn how to streamline data processing steps;

3.  **Fit Models** to our training set using logistic regression;

4.  **Interpret Accuracy** of our model to see how well our model can "predict" our outcome of interest.

### Step 1. Split data

We didn't split the data we used in the first module. Instead, we used data to *train* our model, and then we used the same data set to evaluate *how good our model performed*, i.e., to *test* our model. This raises an issue: using the same data to train and test our model can lead to something called overfitting, which is when a model learns the specifics in the training data rather than the underlying pattern.

This is related to the bias-variance trade off introduced in the conceptual overview: by using the same data to train and test our model, we run the risk of developing a model with low bias, but high variance. Any changes in the training data could result in a very different model (with far higher bias), which is not ideal. In other words, we want to develop a model that is generalizable to new data, not just the data we used to train it.

The authors of Data Science in Education Using R (Estrellado et al., 2020) remind us that:

> At its core, machine learning is the process of "showing" your statistical model only some of the data at once and training the model to predict accurately on that training dataset (this is the "learning" part of machine learning). Then, the model as developed on the training data is shown new data - data you had all along, but hid from your computer initially - and you see how well the model that you developed on the training data performs on this new testing data. Eventually, you might use the model on entirely new data.

#### Training and Testing Sets

It is therefore common when beginning a modeling project to [separate the data set](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/data-splitting.html) into two partitions:

-   The *training set* is used to estimate, develop and compare models; feature engineering techniques; tune models, etc.

-   The *test set* is held in reserve until the end of the project, at which point there should only be one or two models under serious consideration. It is used as an unbiased source for measuring final model performance.

There are different ways to create these partitions of the data and there is no uniform guideline for determining how much data should be set aside for testing. The proportion of data can be driven by many factors, including the size of the original pool of samples and the total number of predictors.

After you decide how much to set aside, the most common approach for actually partitioning your data is to use a random sample. For our purposes, we'll use random sampling to select 20% for the test set and use the remainder for the training set, which are the defaults for the {[rsample](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/)} package.

#### Split Data Sets

To split our data, we will be using the `train_test_split()` scikit-learn function.

Run the following code to split the data:

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(ipeds_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=20250712)  # splitting the data and sedding a random state so this is reproducible
```

**Note**: Since random sampling uses random numbers, it is important to set the `random_state` parameter as the same value. This ensures that the random numbers can be reproduced at a later time (if needed). We pick the first date on which we may carry out this learning lab as the seed, but any number will work!

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Go ahead and use the `len()` to check that the training data set indeed has 80% of the number of observations as in the larger data. Do that in the chunk below:

```{python}
len(train_df) / len(ipeds_df)  # should = ~0.8
```

### Step 2: Create a "Pipeline"

In this section, we introduce another scikit-learn tool called a Pipeline, which is designed to help you to take raw data through preprocessing steps and a model all in one cohesive method. Some examples of Pipeline steps:

-   Turning categorical variables into multiple binary columns ("One-hot encoding").

-   Scaling numerical values (min-max scaling or standard scaling).

-   Imputing missing values with a mean or median or using a model to estimate missing values.

-   Building a model with a LinearRegression.

We'll dive more into the above steps in later modules, focusing now on just dealing with missing values (Imputation) and building a model.

#### **Prepare the data**

To get started, let's split both the train and test datasets between the independent columns (i.e. "features") and dependent column (i.e. "target" or "outcome"):

```{python}
dependent_col = 'good_grad_rate'  # what we're predicting

independent_cols = [  # what we're using to predict
   'tuition_fees',
   'avg_salary',
   'tuition_to_salary_ratio',
   'percent_fin_aid'
]

X_train = train_df[independent_cols]
y_train = train_df[dependent_col]

X_test = test_df[independent_cols]
y_test = test_df[dependent_col]
```

Since we're predicting a binary outcome (`good_grad_rate`), we will use the scikit-learn `LinearRegression` model. To deal with the blank values (i.e. nulls) that would break the model, we use the scikit-learn SimpleImputer. This fills blank values with a variety of strategies one can specify. In this example we will use "median" which fills blanks with the median value for that column:

Run the following code to finish specifying our model:

```{python}
pipeline = Pipeline(
    steps=[
        ('impute', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
        ('model', LogisticRegression()),
    ]
)
```

### Step 3: Fit model

Running `pipeline.fit()` allows all steps of the pipeline to learn from the training data – the median to fill for each numerical column, and the model weights in the regression. Now when making new predictions we can simply use the `predict()` method.

```{python}
pipeline.fit(X=X_train, y=y_train)
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Let's inspect our pipeline by typing its instance name (the name of the `Pipeline` object) below; this is the final, fitted model---one that can be interpreted further in the next step!

```{python}
pipeline
```

### Step 4: Interpret accuracy

To interpret the model's accuracy we start by making a prediction on the test dataset, then calculating the number of times the prediction and actual outcome value is the same:

```{python}
y_preds = pipeline.predict(X_test)

correct = y_preds == y_test
accuracy = sum(correct) / len(y_test)

print('accuracy:', accuracy)
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

A short-cut to the above is to simply use the scikit-learn `accuracy_score()` function (which we already imported above), taking `y_preds` as the first argument and `y_test` as the second; **we'll use this short-cut from here forward**, having seen how accuracy is calculated. Write that code below.

```{python}
accuracy_score(y_preds, y_test)
```

Let's step back a bit. How well *could* we do if we include more data? And how *useful* could such a model be in the real world? We'll dive into these questions more over the forthcoming modules.

That's it for now; the core parts of machine learning are used in the above steps you took; what we'll do after this leaning lab only adds nuance and complexity to what we've already done.
