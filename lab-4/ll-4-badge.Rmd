As a reminder, to earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts:

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply an analytic technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Part A:

1.  How interpretable or useful is the solution we estimated in the case study?

-   

2.  How might a qualitative analysis follow from the Latent Profile Analysis we carried out? What steps could you take in a qualitative investigation? Think broadly and creatively here!

-   

Part B: Once last time, use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies unsupervised machine learning to an educational context aligned with your research interests. More specifically, **locate a study that involve using Latent Profile Analysis or a similar method**. You may find the published papers that have used LPA helpful in this respect; those can be browsed [here](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C34&q=tidylpa&btnG=).

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What research questions were the authors of this study trying to address using Latent Profile Analysis or a similar method?

    -   

3.  What were the results of these analyses?

    -   

4.  Lastly, what value might a Computational Grounded Theory analysis have in the context of their analysis?

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

Like the last data product, this one may be a challenge, too. Here, estimate latent profiles using *your own data*. If you do not have ready access to appropriate data (for LPA, continuous/numeric data), choose any of the data sets in the `data` folder of this repository.

```{r}

```

Please interpret the results of your analysis below. What did you find? How interpretable and useful are the profiles? And, what next steps - including those involving qualitative analysis - might you take to deepen this analysis?

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Prediction badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review:

1.  Change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):

    -   Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account.

    -   Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [ML badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/machine-learning/discussions/2). In your post, include a link to your published web page and a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
