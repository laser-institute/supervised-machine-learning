## 1. PREPARE

### The LASER workflow

Each supervised machine learning "case study" is designed to illustrate how supervised machine learning methods and techniques can be applied to address a research question of interest, create useful data products, and conduct reproducible research. Each case study is structured around a basic analytics workflow modeled after the Data-Intensive Research Workflow from [Learning Analytics Goes to School](#0) (Krumm et al., 2018):

Figure 2.2 Steps of Data-Intensive Research Workflow

In the overview presentation for this learning lab, we considered five steps in our supervised machine learning process. Those steps are mirrored here in this case study, with the addition of some other components of this workflow. For example, to help prepare for analysis, we'll first take a step back and think about how we want to use machine learning, and *predicting* is a key word. Many scholars have focused on predicting students who are *at-risk*: of dropping a course or not succeeding in it. In the ML Learning Lab 1 case study will cover the following workflow topics as we attempt to develop our own model for predicting student drop-out:

1.  **Prepare**: Prior to analysis, we'll look at the context from which our data came, formulate a basic research question, and get introduced the {tidymodels} packages for machine learning.

2.  **Wrangle**: Wrangling data entails the work of cleaning, transforming, and merging data. In Part 2 we focus on importing CSV files and modifying some of our variables.

3.  **Explore**: We take a quick look at our variables of interest and do some basic "feature engineering" by creating some new variables we think will be predictive of students at risk.

4.  **Model:** We dive deeper into the five steps in our supervised machine learning process, focusing on the mechanics of **making predictions**.

5.  **Communicate:** To wrap up our case study, we'll create our first "data product" and share our analyses and findings by creating our first web page using R Markdown.

In this module, we will be using data from the [IPEDS, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/). We use Zong and Davis' (2022) study as an inspiration for ours. These authors used inferential models to try to understand what relates to the graduation rates of around 700 four-year universities in the United States, predicting this outcome on the basis of student background, finance, academic and social environment, and retention rate independent variables. You can find this in the `lit` folder (with an elaboration and discussion questions in the Readings file for this module).

### Loading packages

As highlighted in [Chapter 6 of Data Science in Education Using R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c06.html) (DSIEUR), one of the first steps of every workflow should be to set up your "Project" structure. Recall that:

> A **Project** is the home for all of the files, images, reports, and code that are used in any given project

Since we are working from a Python project cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/laser-institute), a Project has already been set up for you. Instead, we will focus on getting our project set up with the requisite Python Libraries we'll need for analysis.

**Libraries**, are shareable collections of Python code that can contain functions, data, and/or documentation and extend the functionality of the base Python language. Libraries are loaded with the "import" keyword often with a namespace; e.g., `import pandas as pd`.

#### pandas 🐼

![](img/Pandas_logo.png){width="20%"}

One of the core libraries we’ll use throughout LASER is **`pandas`**, Python’s go-to toolkit for working with data in tabular form. The `pandas` library provides powerful, flexible data structures — especially the `DataFrame`, which is similar to R’s `tibble`.

With `pandas`, you can:

-   read and write data from a variety of formats (like CSV, Excel, and SQL)

-   filter, reshape, and summarize datasets

-   and perform complex data transformations with concise, readable code

Think of `pandas` as the Python equivalent of the tidyverse’s **data wrangling** toolkit.

To get started, you can import the library like this:

```{python}
#| eval: false
import pandas as pd
```

#### scikit-learn 🤖

[![](img/sklearn_logo.png){width="20%"}](https://scikit-learn.org/)

[`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) is Python’s most widely used library for machine learning and statistical modeling. It provides a consistent and intuitive API for building and evaluating models — similar in spirit to R’s `tidymodels`.

With `scikit-learn`, you can:

-   split data into training and test sets

-   preprocess features with pipelines

-   train a wide variety of models (regression, classification, clustering, etc.)

-   tune hyperparameters and evaluate performance

It’s designed to be modular and composable, making it easy to build repeatable workflows that integrate cleanly with `pandas` and other scientific Python libraries.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

In addition to pandas and sci-kit learn (sklearn) we will also use the statsmodels library to do regression analysis with its formula interface.

Use the code chunk below to load pandas and statsmodels.

```{python}
import pandas as pd 
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
```

Tip: Avoid using wildcard imports (like `from module import *`) when loading a library. Instead, import the full library, import a specific function (`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split` -- we'll use this later!) or use a clear alias (`import statsmodels.formula.api as smf`). This helps keep your namespace clean, avoids conflicts, and makes your code easier to read and maintain.

### Loading data

Next, we'll read in data. We'll use the pandas `read_csv()` function to load the data file.

For now, please read in the \`ipeds-all-title-9-2022-data.csv\` file. Use the `read_csv()` function to do this, paying attention to where those files are located relative to this case study file – in the data folder!

```{python}
ipeds_df = pd.read_csv("data/ipeds-all-title-9-2022-data.csv")
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

In the chunk below, examine the data set using a function or means of your choice (such as just *printing* the data set by typing its name or using the `.head()` method). Do this in the code chunk below! Note its dimensions --- especially how many rows it has!

```{python}
ipeds_df.head()
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Write down a few observations after inspecting the data - and any all observations welcome!

## 2. WRANGLE

These code names are pretty long. Let's clean them up by mapping them and then selecting only the columns we need.

```{python}
column_map = {
    'institution name': 'name',
    'HD2022.Postsecondary and Title IV institution indicator': 'title_iv',  # is the university a title IV university?
    'HD2022.Carnegie Classification 2021: Basic': 'carnegie_class',  # which carnegie classification
    'HD2022.State abbreviation': 'state',  # state
    'DRVEF2022.Total  enrollment': 'total_enroll',  # total enrollment
    'DRVADM2022.Percent admitted - total': 'pct_admitted',  # percentage of applicants admitted
    "DRVC2022.Bachelor's degree": 'n_bach',  # number of students receiving a bachelor's degree
    "DRVC2022.Master's degree": 'n_mast',  # number of students receiving a master's degree
    "DRVC2022.Doctor's degree - research/scholarship": 'n_doc',  # number receive a doctoral degree
    'DRVIC2022.Tuition and fees, 2021-22': 'tuition_fees',  # total cost of tuition and fees
    'DRVGR2022.Graduation rate, total cohort': 'grad_rate',  # graduation rate
    'SFA2122.Percent of full-time first-time undergraduates awarded any financial aid': 'percent_fin_aid',  # percent of students receive financial aid
    'DRVHR2022.Average salary equated to 9 months of full-time instructional staff - all ranks': 'avg_salary'  # average salary of instructional staff
}

ipeds_df = ipeds_df.rename(columns=column_map)  # first map column names ... 
ipeds_df = ipeds_df[column_map.values()]  # then select the columns it mapped.
```

A useful method for exploring data is `.value_counts()`; it does what it sounds like! It operates on a column of a DataFrame and counts how many times values for a variable appear.

```{python}
ipeds_df['title_iv'].value_counts()  # if you want to know proportions of each value you can use the normalize=True parameter like `.value_counts(normalize=True)`
```

This suggests we may wish to filter the 30 non-Title IV institutions --- something we'll do shortly.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Can you count another variable? Pick another (see the code chunk two above) and add a count below. While simple, counting up different values in our data can be very informative (and can often lead to further explorations)!

```{python}
ipeds_df['state'].value_counts(normalize=True)  # try the normalize parameter
```

### Filtering

`.query()` is a very handy pandas method; it filters to *include* (or *exclude*) observations in your data based upon logical conditions (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<=`, etc.). See more [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html) if interested.

Below, we filter the data to include only Title IV postsecondary institutions.

```{python}
ipeds_df = ipeds_df.query('title_iv == "Title IV postsecondary institution"')  # filter to Title IV
```

Consider checking that this filtering worked by running `.value_counts()` again on the `title_iv` column.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Can you filter the data again, this time to *only* include institutions with a carnegie classification?

In other words, can you exclude those institutions with a value for the `carnegie_class` variable that is "Not applicable, not in Carnegie universe (not accredited or nondegree-granting)")? A little hint: whereas the logical operator `==` is used to include only matching conditions, the logical operator `!=` excludes matching conditions.

```{python}
ipeds_df = ipeds_df.query('carnegie_class != "Not applicable, not in Carnegie universe (not accredited or nondegree-granting)"')
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

We're cruising! Let's take another peak at our data - using `.head()` or another means of your choosing below.

```{python}
ipeds_df.head()
```

## 3. EXPLORE

One key step in most analyses is to explore the data. Here, we conduct an exploratory data analysis with the IPEDS data, focusing on the key outcome of graduate rate.

Below, we use the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) package (part of base Python) to visualize the *spread* of the values of our dependent variable, `grad_rate`, which represents institutions' graduation rate. There is a *lot* to matplotlib, and data visualizations are not the focus of this module. While useful for quickly validating data, consider exploring more advanced Python data visualization libraries such as [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/).

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

plt.style.use('ggplot')  # optional for beautification

plt.hist(ipeds_df['grad_rate'].values, bins=30, edgecolor='white', color='skyblue')
plt.xlabel('Graduation Rate (%)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Institutions')
plt.show()
```

What do you notice about this graph -- and about graduation rate?

-   YOUR RESPONSE

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Below, can you add one matplotlib plot with a different variable/variables? Use the matplotlib page linked above (also [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html)) or the code above as a starting point (another histogram is fine!) for your visualization.

```{python}
plt.hist(ipeds_df['avg_salary'].values, bins=30, edgecolor='white', color='skyblue')
plt.xlabel('Average Salary of Instructional Staff (USD)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Institutions')
plt.show()
```

We'll next do a little additional data wrangling. For now, we'll model our dependent variable, `grad_rate`, as a dichotomous (i.e., yes or no; 1 or 0) dependent variable. This isn't necessary, but it makes the contrast between the regression and supervised machine learning model a bit more vivid, and also dichotomous and categorical outcome variables are common in supervised machine learning applications, and so we'll do this for this case study.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Your next task is to decide what constitutes a good graduation rate. Our only suggestion - don't pick a number *too* close to 0% or 100%. Otherwise, please replace XXX below with the number from 0-100 that represents the graduation rate percentage. Just add the number --- don't add the percentage symbol. This code uses a common Python library used in data wrangling [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).

```{python}

import numpy as np 

ipeds_df['good_grad_rate'] = np.where(ipeds_df['grad_rate'] > 75, 1, 0)
```

Here, add a reason or two for how and why you picked the number you did:

## 4. MODEL

Now, we reach a fork in the road. Recall from our first reading that there are two general types of modeling approaches: unsupervised and supervised machine learning. In Part 4, we focus on supervised learning models, which are used to quantify relationships between features (e.g., motivation and performance) and a known outcome (e.g., student drop out). These models can be used for classification of binary or categorical outcomes, as we'll illustrate in this section, or regression as we'll demonstrate in modules 2 and 3.

Please write out preliminary, draft research questions for both a regression (RQ A) and supervised machine learning (RQ B) analysis. It may help to review the readings for this module; you can find them in the `lit` folder; they are listed in `sml-1-readings.qmd`, too. There aren't right or wrong answers here; the point is to try to draw out what question might accompany these different analyses (or vice versa - what research questions are feasible to answer using different analyses).

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

### RQ A - Regression Research Question

-   YOUR RESEARCH QUESTION

### RQ B - Supervised Machine Learning Research Question

-   YOUR RESEARCH QUESTION

Now, we will proceed to the analyses.

We'll first conduct a regression analysis, like in the code-along. We use a logistic regression (`smf.logit`) due to the dependent variable being dichotomous. The code is relatively straightforward; the comments explain each step.

```{python}
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf  # load the statsmodels formula API as smf

model = smf.logit(
    formula='good_grad_rate ~ total_enroll + pct_admitted + n_bach + n_mast + n_doc + tuition_fees + percent_fin_aid + avg_salary',  # define the formula
    data=ipeds_df  # provide the dataset that contains those columns
).fit()  # train the model on the entire dataset

model.summary()  # print the statistical summary for the regression analysis
```

Then, we'll conduct a supervised machine learning analysis (with a simple but still commonly used model - in fact, the same model we used for the regression, a logistic regression model!). Again, for now, you'll run this code; later, you'll work through each step in detail.

One note – you'll see here we use a value of .20 for the proportion of the data in the test set (and .80 in the training data set). For now, know that this isn't a hard rule, but, rather, the "best" split depends on a few considerations that we'll discuss in a later module.

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

ipeds_df = ipeds_df.dropna()  # Scikit-learn does not support null values, so we’ll drop them for now. In later modules, we’ll explore imputation techniques to handle missing data

dependent_col = 'good_grad_rate'  # the name of the value that we are modeling - the 1/0 column for a good graduation rate
independent_cols = [  # the independent columns to predict the dependent column
    'total_enroll',
    'pct_admitted',
    'n_bach',
    'n_mast',
    'n_doc',
    'tuition_fees',
    'percent_fin_aid',
    'avg_salary'
]

X = ipeds_df[independent_cols]  # split our dataset between dependent and independent columns
y = ipeds_df[dependent_col]

model = LogisticRegression()  # Define the model object. Here is where we coul set any model parameters in the future
model.fit(X=X, y=y)  # Fit the model on the enire dataset

y_preds = model.predict(X)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_preds)  # use sklearn built in functions to evaluate accuracy

print('accuracy:', round(accuracy, 3))
```

The key to observe at this point is what is similar and different between the two approaches (regression and supervised machine learning). Both used the same underlying statistical model, but had some stark differences. Add two or more similarities and two or more differences (no wrong answers!) below.

## 5. COMMUNICATE

The final step in the workflow/process is sharing the results of your analysis with wider audience. Krumm et al. (2018) have outlined the following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders findings from an analysis:

1.  **Select.** Communicating what one has learned involves selecting among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form, i.e. a "data product."

2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products, research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with colors and shapes to highlight key points.

3.  **Narrate.** Writing a narrative to accompany the data products involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related research question, describing how best to interpret the data product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps answer the research question.

Now, let's return to our research questions. What did we find? This (especially the supervised machine learning model and its output) is very likely new, and this is meant to elicit initial perceptions, and not the right answer. What did we find for each of your RQs? Add a few thoughts below for each. Focus on what you would communicate about this analysis to a general audience, again, keeping in mind this is based on your very initial interpretations.
