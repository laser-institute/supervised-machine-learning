# Purpose and Agenda

## Purpose (All Modules!)

Machine learning is increasingly prevalent in our lives---and in educational contexts. Its role in educational research and practice is growing, albeit with some challenges and even controversy. These modules are designed to familiarize you with supervised machine learning and its applications in STEM education research. Throughout the module, we'll explore four key questions that correspond to the focus of each of the four modules. By the end, you will have a deep understanding of the key characteristics of supervised machine learning and how to implement supervised machine learning workflows in R and Python.

::: {.notes}
This is from the overview of the module -- it is just a high-level overview of the topic.

# Discussion 1

::: {.notes}
The discussions that follow are optional, but they can be really rich.
:::

::: panel-tabset

## Getting Started

- Explain why are you interested in machine learning.

::: {.notes}
This is really just to get people talking - low stakes! Look for ideas related to SML.
:::

## Digging Deeper

- Is there a specific use case of machine learning in which you are especially interested? Consider the data and purpose.

::: {.notes}
Like the above, this is meant to elicit thoughts on SML - try to draw those out, or point out cases of unsupervised ML or regression and try to contrast those.

# Key Concept #1

## Machine learning

![](img/gpt-4.png){fig-align="center"}

*Builds upon supervised machine learning models--namely, deep neural networks, the likes of which can be estimated within R; the big advance has to do with the transformer architecture that allows for the fitting of more complex models. It is still important (maybe necessary) to learn about the foundational techniques and methodologies underlying GPT-4.*

## Defining ML

-   *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* (i.e., [GPT-4](https://openai.com/api/)): Simulating human intelligence through the use of computers
-   *Machine learning (ML)*: A subset of AI focused on how computers acquire new information/knowledge

This definition leaves a lot of space for a range of approaches to ML

## Supervised ML

-   Requires coded data or data with a known outcome
-   Uses coded/outcome data to train an algorithm
-   Uses that algorithm to **predict the codes/outcomes for new data** (data not used during the training)
-   Can take the form of a *classification* (predicting a dichotomous or categorical outcome) or a *regression* (predicting a continuous outcome)
-   Algorithms include:
    -   [Linear regression (really!)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
    -   Logistic regression
    -   Random forest
    -   Neural network

## What kind of coded data?

> Want to detect spam? Get samples of spam messages. Want to forecast stocks? Find the price history. Want to find out user preferences? Parse their activities on Facebook (no, Mark, stop collecting it, enough!) (from [ML for Everyone](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/))

In educational research:

-   Assessment data (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09895-9))
-   Data from log files ("trace data") (e.g., [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2013.837391?casa_token=-8Fm2KCFJ30AAAAA%3Altbc8Y8ci_z-uLJx4se9tgvru9mzm3yqCTFi12ndJ5uM6RDl5YJGG6_4KpUgIK5BYa_Ildeh2qogoQ))
-   Open-ended written responses (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09889-7), [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09761-w))
-   Achievement data (i.e., end-of-course grades) (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09888-8), [2](https://search.proquest.com/docview/2343734516?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true))

## How is this different from regression?

The *aim* is different, the algorithms and methods of estimation are not (or, are differences in degree, rather than in kind).

In a linear regression, our aim is to estimate parameters, such as $\beta_0$ (intercept) and $\beta_1$ (slope), and to make inferences about them that are not biased by our particular sample.

In an ML approach, we can use the same linear regression model, but with a goal other than making unbiased inferences about the $\beta$ parameters:

In supervised ML, our goal is to minimize the difference between a known $y$ and our predictions, $\hat{y}$.

## It's the same!

We can use the same model for an inferential or a predictive approach:

$y$ = $b_0$ + $b_1$ + ... + $e$

If we are interested in making inferences about a particular $b$ (e.g., $b_1$), we can use theory and prior research to include particular predictors

If we are interested in making the best possible predictions, we can add a *bunch* of predictors and see how much we can minimize the prediction error

## But different!

This *predictive goal* means that we can do things differently:

-   Multicollinearity is not an issue because we do not care to make inferences about parameters
-   Because interpreting specific parameters is less of an interest, we can use a great deal more predictors
-   We focus on how accurately a *trained* model can predict the values in *test* data (though, we'll only use one data set only in this module)
-   We can make our models very complex - we can choose different models!

## Okay, *really* complex

-   Neutral/deep networks
    -   i.e., GPT-3 (175 B parameters), GPT-4 (\>1 T parameters)
-   And, some models can take a different form than familiar regressions:
    -   *k*-nearest neighbors
    -   Decision trees (and their extensions of bagged and random forests)
-   Last, the modeling process can look different:
    -   Ensemble models that combine or improve on ("boosting") the predictions of individual models

## Unsupervised ML

- Does not require coded data; one way to think about unsupervised ML is that its purpose is to discover codes/labels
- Can be used in an _exploratory mode_ (see [Nelson, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124118769114?casa_token=EV5XH31qbyAAAAAA%3AFg09JQ1XHOOzlxYT2SSJ06vZv0jG-s4Qfz8oDIQwh2jrZ-jrHNr7xZYL2FwnZtZiokhPalvV1RL2Bw)) 
- **Warning**: The results of unsupervised ML _cannot_ directly be used to provide codes/outcomes for supervised ML techniques 
- Algorithms include:
  - Cluster analysis and Latent Profile Analysis
  - [Principle Components Analysis (really!)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)

## Which technique should I choose?

Do you have coded data or data with a known outcome -- let's say about K-12 students -- and, do you want to:

- _Predict_ how other students with similar data (but without a known outcome) perform?
- _Scale_ coding that you have done for a sample of data to a larger sample?
- _Provide timely or instantaneous feedback_, like in many learning analytics systems?

**Supervised methods may be your best bet**

## Which technique should I choose?

Do you not yet have codes/outcomes -- and do you want to?

- _Achieve a starting point_ for qualitative coding, perhaps in a ["computational grounded theory"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124117729703) mode?
- _Discover groups or patterns in your data_ that may be of interest?
- _Reduce the number of variables in your dataset_ to a smaller, but perhaps nearly as explanatory/predictive - set of variables?

**Unsupervised methods may be helpful**

## Which technique should I choose?

Do you want to say something about one or several variables' relations with an outcome?

-   Understand whether an intervention was effective
-   See how one or more variables relates to an outcome

**Traditional, inferential statistics *i.e., regression* may be best**

## How do I select a model?

One general principle is to **start with the simplest useful model** and to _build toward
more complex models as helpfuL_.

This principle applies in multiple ways:

- To choose an algorithm, start with simpler models that you can efficiently use and understand
- To carry out feature engineering, understand your predictors well by starting with a subset
- To tune an algorithm, start with a relatively simple set of tuning parameters

This isn't just for beginners or science education researchers; [most spam filters use Support Vector Machines (and used Naive Bayes until recently)](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/) due to their combination of effectiveness and efficiency "in production."

## What's stopping me from specifying a complex model?

- Nothing too much, apart from computing power, time, and concerns of 
- A "check" on your work is your predictions on _test_ set data
  - *Train data*: Coded/outcome data that you use to train ("estimate") your model
  - *Validation data<sup>1</sup>*: Data you use to select a particular algorithm
  - *Test ("hold-out") data*: Data that you do not use in any way to train your data

- An important way to achieve good performance with test data is to balance between the inherent _bias_ in your algorithm and the _variance_ in the predictions of your algorithm; this is referred to as the **bias-variance** trade-off of _all_ models

[1] not always/often used, for reasons we'll discuss later

## Illustrating the bias-variance tradeoff

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(5)
dat = data.frame(x = runif(1000, 0, 12))
dat$x = sort(dat$x)
dat$y = with(dat, sin(x * 1.3) * 15 + 3 * (x - 4)^2)
sigma = with(dat, (exp(x - 5)/(1 + exp(x - 5)) - exp(x - 7)/(1 + exp(x - 7)) * 
    2) + 1.4) * 6
dat$yobs = dat$y + rnorm(nrow(dat), mean = 0, sd = sigma)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = yobs)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgray") +
  ylab("pred")

ggsave("img/bias-variance-data-1.png")
```

## A strongly biased algorithm (linear model)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", message = FALSE}
dat = data.frame(x = runif(1000, 0, 12))
dat$x = sort(dat$x)
dat$y = with(dat, sin(x * 1.3) * 15 + 3 * (x - 4)^2)
sigma = with(dat, (exp(x - 5)/(1 + exp(x - 5)) - exp(x - 7)/(1 + exp(x - 7)) * 
    2) + 1.4) * 6
dat$yobs = dat$y + rnorm(nrow(dat), mean = 0, sd = sigma)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = yobs)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgray") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ylab("pred")

ggsave("img/bias-variance-data-3.png")
```

## A much less-biased algorithm (GAM/spline)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", message = FALSE}
set.seed(5)
dat = data.frame(x = runif(1000, 0, 12))
dat$x = sort(dat$x)
dat$y = with(dat, sin(x * 1.3) * 15 + 3 * (x - 4)^2)
sigma = with(dat, (exp(x - 5)/(1 + exp(x - 5)) - exp(x - 7)/(1 + exp(x - 7)) * 
    2) + 1.4) * 6
dat$yobs = dat$y + rnorm(nrow(dat), mean = 0, sd = sigma)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = yobs)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgray") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ splines::bs(x, 10), se = FALSE) +
  ylab("pred")

ggsave("img/bias-variance-data-5.png")
```

## Slightly different data (bottom)

```{r, echo = FALSE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
dat = data.frame(x = runif(1000, 0, 12))
dat$x = sort(dat$x)
dat$y = with(dat, sin(x * 2.3) * 25 + 3 * (x - 3)^2)
sigma = with(dat, (exp(x - 5)/(1 + exp(x - 5)) - exp(x - 7)/(1 + exp(x - 7)) * 
    2) + 1.4) * 6
dat$yobs = dat$y + rnorm(nrow(dat), mean = 0, sd = sigma)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = yobs)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgray") +
  ylab("pred")

ggsave("img/bias-variance-data-2.png")

## Still strong bias, but low variance

dat = data.frame(x = runif(1000, 0, 12))
dat$x = sort(dat$x)

## Low bias, but very high variance

## The bias-variance tradeoff

#### Bias

- *Definition*: Difference between our known codes/outcomes and our predicted codes/outcomes; difference between $y$ and $\hat{y}$
- How (in)correct our models' (algorithms') predictions are
- Models with high bias can fail to capture important relationships—they can be *under-fit* to our data
- In short, how well our model reflects the patterns in the data

#### Variance

- *Definition*: Using a different sample of data, the difference in $\hat{y}$ values
- How sensitive our predictions are to the specific sample on which we trained the model
- Models with high variance can fail to predict different data well—they can be *over-fit* to our data
- In short, how stable the predictions of our model are

#### <center>Regardless of model, we often wish to balance between bias and variance—to balance between under- and over-fitting a model to our data</center>

## Reflecting

-   When might you use SML, in general?

## Applying

-   Think back to the use case you mentioned earlier. How does (or could) SML be an appropriate technique to use?
:::

::: {.notes}
This is meant to elicit thoughts from learners on SML, now that we are beginning to develop a language. Learners may mention research questions that sound like they could be answered using traditional inferential methods - lean into those discussions and be open to the possibility that interesting questions do *not* require SML, and use these conversations to try to shape inferential (i.e., those answerable with regression models and their extensions) questions into predictive (i.e., those answerable with SML) ones.

# Modules Overview

::: panel-tabset
## Module 1

**SML Module 1: Foundations**

How is prediction different from explanation? This lab provides a gentle introduction to supervised machine learning by drawing out similarities to and differences from a regression modeling approach. The case study will involve modeling the graduation rate across 1000s of higher education institutions in the United States using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).

## Module 2

**SML Module 2: Workflows With Training and Testing Data**

Building on the foundations from Lab 1, this session delves deeper into the workflows we will use when we are using a SML approach. Particularly, we'll explore the roles of training and testing data and when to use them in a SML workflow. We'll predict students' withdrawal from a course using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD).

## Module 3

**SML Module 3: Interpreting SML Metrics**

How is the interpretation of SML models different from more familiar models? In this lab, we'll explore and work to understand the confusion matrix that can and the various metrics (e.g., precision, recall, PPV, NPV, F-score, and AUC) that are used to interpret how good at making dichotomous predictions SML models are. We'll again use the OULAD, augmenting the variables we used in Lab 1, and we'll introduce a more complex model---the random forest model---as an alternative to the regression models used in previous labs.

## Module 4

**SML Module 4: Improving Predictions Through Feature Engineering**

How can we improve our predictions? This lab introduces the concept of feature engineering to enhance model performance. We'll explore techniques for creating new variables and refining existing ones to improve prediction accuracy. We also explore cross-validation to revise and refine our model without biasing its predictions. We'll work with the finest-grained OULAD data—interaction data—to demonstrate key feature engineering steps.
:::

::: {.notes}
A key point to make here is that each lab introduces a tension/issue that is resolved by the subsequent labs - the first doesn't use training data, which can lead to over-confident (i.e., biased) metrics of predictive accuracy; the second introduces testing data, but only naively interprets the predictive goodness of the models; the third includes the major components apart from feature engineering and resampling (feature engineering), which is the focus of the fourth. By the fourth, learners will engage will all of the fundamental elements of a supervised machine learning analysis.
