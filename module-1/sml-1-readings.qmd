## Overview

The goal of this module is to begin to understand how a supervised machine learning (i.e., a predictive model) differs from a more traditional regression model.

## Readings

**These readings are all in the `/lit` folder in the main directory for supervised-machine-learning.**

## Reflection

To help guide your reflection on the readings, a set of guiding questions are provided below. After you have had a chance to work through one or more of the readings, **we encourage you to contribute to our learning community by creating a new post to our supervised-machine-learning channel on [Slack](http://laser-scholars.slack.com/)**. Your post might contain a response to one or more of the guiding questions, questions you still have about the topics addressed, or insights gained into your own research.

### Brooks & Thompson (2017)

-   The authors distinguish between explanatory and predictive modeling. Discuss the key differences between these two approaches and provide examples of how each can be applied in educational settings.

-   Reflect on the ethical considerations of using supervised machine learning in educational contexts. What are the potential ethics-related risks, and how can institutions ensure that their use of predictive analytics promotes equity and fairness among students?

### Jaquette & Parra (2013)

-   What are some of the attributes of IPEDS that make it useful for research?

-   How could you use data to answer a question related to your research interests?

### Zong and Davis (2022)

-   Zong and Davis utilize the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to model university retention and graduation rates. What are the strengths and limitations of using IPEDS data for this purpose, and how might these affect the study's conclusions?

-   Discuss the potential impact of predictive modeling on university policy and student support services. How can universities implement these findings to enhance student retention and graduation rates effectively?
